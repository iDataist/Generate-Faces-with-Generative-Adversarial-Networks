# Generate Faces with Generative Adversarial Networks

I built a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), which is made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.

Key Skills Demonstrated
- Process the image data
- Build and train a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network with PyTorch
- Optimize hyperparameters
